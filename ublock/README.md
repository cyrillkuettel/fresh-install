# uBlock Origin Filter List
uBlock Origin is more than an ad-blocker. It's a content personalization tool. 

# The SEO Crap
I use custom filters to remove sites that I don't want to appear in my google searches. Crap like Quora and Pinterest being the most notable examples, along with the thousands of stackoverflow copy-cats. 

# Getting Started
- Install uBlock Origin Extension
- It will appear in the taskbar, click on it
- go to Settings -> My filters and paste the list
