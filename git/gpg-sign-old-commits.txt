Useful oneliner to sign all commits in a repository, 
if you forgot to set `git config commit.gpgsign true` and made some (local) commits.
NOTE: Not recommended if you pushed changes already (rewrites history).

git rebase --exec 'git commit --amend --no-edit -n -S' -i --root master

 master can be a commit as well
