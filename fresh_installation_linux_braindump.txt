git
jdk setup: get from https://github.com/rgisler/ubuntu-oraclejdk-8/blob/master/Dockerfile

android studio
intellij: both the same process, extract the tar.gz and unzip to 
could get the useful information 
manage the ssh keys would be nice. generate one in .ssh automatically. You can check this from github. The key can probably be added programmatically to github, I have to reasearch this.

jdk from switch drive https://drive.switch.ch/index.php/s/nz0UdWDlSQ9ogDX/download?path=%2F01_jdk_11.0&files=jdk-11.0.13_linux-x64_bin.tar.gz
